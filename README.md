## Tracking Learning Progress

Learning Basics: <br>

1. Learning how to download / install Java 17 JKD (with LTS) from Amazon Corretto.
2. Set up my code editor (VS Code) with Extension Pack for Java support / code completion / Java breakpoint debugging.
3. Created and ran first Java script. (Easy and basic Hello World script to verify everything is working.)

- learn about Java classes and proper conventions for file names (CamelCase), class names (class name must match file name), and initiating the main method for Java (which is very similar to C Programming)

4. Java Debugger not working at breakpoints.

- Google how to resolve Java debugger not working
- resolved using GitHub article at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-debug/blob/main/Troubleshooting.md

5. Learn syntax for how to initiate variables in Java.

- variable types are similar to other programming languages such as C and Python (including primitive types such as int, long, double, String, and char)
- normal standards for choosing type that uses the least memory for optimal performance
- syntax conventions are different for long and char (long must have an "L" at the end and char is single quotes)

6. Learning the standard mathematical operators that are available across programming languages.
7. Learn how to cast type with Java.
8. Use Scanner to collect user input: <br>
```nextInt()``` - scan for int <br>
```nextDouble()``` - scan for double <br>
```nextLine()``` - scan for text <br>
